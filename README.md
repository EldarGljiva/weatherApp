## What I've Learned

While working on this project, I deepened my understanding of JavaScript (NodeJS, ExpressJS, EJS), HTML, and CSS. What made this experience even more enriching is that it was my first time working with an API. 
 API of my choice was OpenWeather. It was a great experience that taught me how to utilize APIs and made me a more skilled developer.
